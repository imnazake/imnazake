### 2. Download the Plugin  
- Obtain the plugin from the **Epic Games Launcher** or **Fab**.

---

### 3. Copy the Plugin to the Unify Demo Project  
- Navigate to the Unreal Engine directory where the plugin was installed.  
- Copy the plugin to the **Plugins** folder in the Unify demo project.  

---

### 4. Regenerate Visual Studio Solution Files  
- Regenerate the project solution files to ensure the plugin is integrated correctly.

---

### 5. Open the Project in Unreal Engine  
- Open the Unify demo project in Unreal Engine to proceed with further setup.

---

---

### 7. Reparent the Abilities C++ Classes 
- You will need to open the project source code in your IDE to do this. 
- Go to **Tools > Open Rider (Or Visual Studio)**.  
- In your IDE navigate to `Plugins/GameplayInteraction/Source/GameplayInteraction/Public/Core/Abilities`
- Reparent the following ability classes:
      - **UGameplayAbility_Interact** > Parent (**UUnifyGameplayAbility**)
      - **UGameplayAbility_Interaction** > Parent (**UUnifyGameplayAbility**)
      - **UGameplayAbility_Interaction_ShowOptions** > Parent (**UUnifyGameplayAbility**)
- Add the required includes for the header files
      - Remove this include `#include "Abilities/GameplayAbility.h"`
      - Add this include instead `"AbilitySystem/Abilities/UnifyGameplayAbility.h"` 
- Add the `Unify` module name in `GameplayInteraction.Build.cs` in `PublicDependencyModuleNames`
- Save all changes, close the unreal editor and then recompile again and launch the editor.

:::warning Avoid Circular Dependency Issues

To prevent circular dependency issues in your project, it is recommended to **move the ability classes** from the plugin source folder:

```
Plugins/GameplayInteraction/Source/GameplayInteraction/Public/Core/Abilities
```

into your **project source directory** where you have your own abilities.

Alternatively, you can:

- **Copy the ability classes**
- **Rename them** appropriately in your project
- Use these copies instead of referencing the original plugin ability classes

This approach is especially useful if:

- You have your **own subclass** of `UGameplayAbility`
- You want your abilities to **work consistently** with your project-specific code
- You want to **avoid reparenting** plugin classes directly, which often leads to circular dependencies and other complications

By using your own project-local versions of the abilities, you ensure better integration and avoid tight coupling with the plugin.
