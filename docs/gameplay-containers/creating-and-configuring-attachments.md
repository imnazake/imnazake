# Creating And Configuring Attachments

This guide explains how to set up attachments for items using item definition data assets. Attachments allow items (like weapons) to support modular add-ons such as scopes, barrels, or accessories.

---

## 1. Create or Use an Existing Item Definition

Start by creating a new item definition or using an existing one (e.g., a weapon item).  
If youâ€™re not sure how to create an item definition, refer to the [Creating New Items](creating-new-items).

---

## 2. Add an Attachments Fragment

Once you have your item definition:

- Add an **Attachments Fragment** to the item (e.g., for a weapon).
- This fragment enables the item to accept attachments.

## 3. Configure the Attachments Fragment

Now, set up how the item handles attachments by adding **Attachment Slots**:

Each slot configuration includes:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Attachment Slot Type** | Identifies the slot type (e.g., `Scope`, `Muzzle`, `Magazine`). |
| **Supported Items Definitions** | Specifies which items can be attached in that slot. |
| **Max Quantity** | Defines how many of that attachment can be added to the slot. |
| **Startup Attachments** | Indicates which attachments should be added or attached to the main item when it gets created. |

:::info
In **Startup Attachments**, if `Is Partial` is checked, the system will attempt to attach *any possible quantity* of the item to the main item when it gets created â€” not necessarily meeting the specified quantity.  
If `Is Partial` is **not** checked, it will only attach the **exact specified quantity**. If that operation fails nothing will be attached.
:::

### ðŸ”’ Quantity Rules

- The **max quantity**:
  - Cannot exceed the **attachment itemâ€™s max stack size**.
  - Should be between `1` and the **max stack size** of the attached item.
  - Can also be explicitly defined, as long as it doesnâ€™t exceed the attached itemâ€™s stack size.

> If a Magazine has a `Bullets` attachment slot, you might allow only 30 bullet items to be attached, and it must be from a list of supported item definitions.

## 4. Handling Attachment Logic in Item Instances

Once youâ€™ve configured your attachments, you can define how your item reacts when attachments are added, removed, or updated.

You have two main options:

- **Use a general-purpose item instance** (Blueprint or C++) to handle all attachment logic for similar items.
- **Create specific item instance Blueprints or C++ classes** for each item (e.g., per weapon), then assign them in the corresponding item definitions.

> These item instances will be used automatically when an item is created.

---

### Handling Attachment Events

You can respond to the following **attachment-related events** in your item instance class:

- **On Attachment Added**
- **On Attachment Removed**
- **On Attachment Updated**

Common use cases include:

- Setting or swapping **static meshes or skeletal parts** on the **Gameplay Equipment Actor** (e.g., adding a scope or suppressor mesh).
- Modifying **item stats** based on the stats or tags of the attached items.
- Applying or removing **Gameplay Effects** when attachments change.
- Overriding attachment behavior for specific items.

---

### Gameplay Equipment Actor

The **Gameplay Equipment Actor** is an actor spawned when an item (like a weapon) is equipped. It requires the item to have an **Equipment Fragment**.

To support custom logic:

- You can create **custom equipment actor classes** that inherit from the base equipment actor.
- Add specific logic or components related to attachments in those child classes.
- Keep core logic centralized in the item instance to maintain consistency across weapons.

---

### Optional: Base Classes for Weapons

If youâ€™re working with multiple weapon items, consider creating a **child item instance base class** specifically for weapons (e.g., `WeaponItemInstance`).

This allows you to:

- Centralize weapon-specific logic such as:
  - Shooting behavior
  - Trace or sweep-based hit detection
  - Recoil tuning
  - Damage modifiers
- Keep your code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
- Add shared functionality for all weapon items while allowing for per-weapon customization via further child classes.

---

## 5. Testing Attachments In-Game

After setting up your items and attachment logic, you can now test them in-game.

There are two ways to test attachments:

- **Auto Attach on Startup**  
  If you've configured **Startup Attachments**, these will automatically attach to the item when it's created (e.g., when added to the inventory or spawned).

- **Manual Attach/Detach via UI**  
  Use your in-game inventory UI to manually:
  
  - **Attach** supported items to available attachment slots by **dragging the attachment item and dropping it over the main item** that supports attachments.
  
  - **Detach** attachments in one of the following ways:
    - **Alt + Right-Click** the main item to open the context menu, then select **"Detach All Items"**.  
      > This requires the main item to have an **Actions Fragment** with the **Detach All Items** action added.  
      
      > (This input is the default in the *Unify Project*, but may differ in your setup.)
    
    - **Control + Left-Click** the main item to open the **attachments menu**, allowing for manual detachment.  
      > - **Click on an attached item** to detach it and return it to the container (e.g., inventory) where the main item exists.
      > - **Click the button at the bottom of each attachment slot** to see a list of compatible attachments.  
      >   Selecting any of these will automatically attach it to the main item in that slot.

      > (This input is the default in the *Unify Demo Project*, but may also differ depending on your configuration.)

Observe how the item responds to these actions â€” visually, statistically, or via gameplay effects â€” and confirm that attachment behavior is working as intended.
